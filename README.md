# Project Summary

This project was an attempt at creating a daily tasks web application with working buttons and a date display that updates in real time.

The goal was to create the app using React framework and style it minamally using CSS.

!!! Currently, I am still figuring out how to optomize the live display of time and I ran into a few errors concerning the functions that display time in {App.js}

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
