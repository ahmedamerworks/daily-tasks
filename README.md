# Project Summary

This project was an attempt at creating a daily tasks web application with working buttons and a date display that updates in real time.

At the current stage, the Tasks component is functional and the time display works - Next steps are to incorporate a date with the time, a {delete all tasks} button, and a better way to stack tasks in case they stretch outside the webpage ~

Known bugs:

- Not fully responsive for mobile devices.
- You are able to add a nameless task.

Updates 18/11/2023:

- New and more intuitive font-style
- Two new buttons: One to delete all tasks, one to show them!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
